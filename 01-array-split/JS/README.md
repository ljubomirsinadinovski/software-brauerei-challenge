# SETUP

The project is made using NodeJS.
1. In order to run it you will have to use the same Node version (documented in the file `.nvmrc`).
If you are using node version manager (nvm) you can just run `nvm use`

2. Define the tests that you want the script to run (modify the run file named `runTests` to add the appropriate files). Make sure the file has executable permissions (can be done using the command `chmod`).

3. [optional] Create your own test files

4. To run the script execute in terminal `./runTests`.

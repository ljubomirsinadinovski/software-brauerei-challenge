# SETUP

The project is made using Java 11 (version 11.0.18).
1. In order to run it you will have to use the same Java version

2. Define the tests that you want the script to run (modify the run file named `RunTests` to add the appropriate files). Make sure the file has executable permissions (can be done using the command `chmod`).

3. [optional] Create your own test files

4. To run the script execute in terminal `./RunTests`.

NOTE: this Java code doesn't accept JSON files

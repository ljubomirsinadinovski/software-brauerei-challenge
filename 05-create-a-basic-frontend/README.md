# SETUP

The project is made using vite, react and typescript.
1. In order to run it you will have to use the same Node version (documented in the file .nvmrc).
If you are using node version manager (nvm) you can just run `nvm use`

2. Navigate to the basic project directory and install the dependencies with your package manager. I used `pnpm`.
The command is `pnpm install`

3. To run the project run the required command defined in `package.json`. For demo purposes run `pnpm run dev`.
